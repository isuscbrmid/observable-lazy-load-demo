# observable-lazy-load-demo
A React POC using observable api for lazy load.

Still a WIP, 
Pending: From the demo the next step will be extracting logic to do a react hook that you can combine with a custom component for loading. 
If no custom loading component is provided, the hook will use the default spinner.
